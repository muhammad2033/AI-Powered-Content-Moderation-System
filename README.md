# AI-Powered-Content-Moderation-System

 
Title: AI-Powered Content Moderation System at ITSOLERA PVT LTD 
# Project Proposal 
# 1. Introduction 
In today’s digital age, managing user-generated content is vital to protect platforms and 
their communities from harmful, abusive, or explicit material. As content volumes increase 
rapidly, manual moderation becomes inefficient and error-prone. This project proposes 
the development of an AI-powered content moderation system that uses deep learning to 
automatically analyze, filter, and report inappropriate content in real-time. 
The system will moderate both text and image content, using Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), respectively. It also offers platform
specific customization, real-time performance, and a user-friendly web interface. 
# 2. Objectives 
• Develop a deep learning system for text and image moderation. 
• Implement real-time filtering and reporting features. 
• Provide customizable moderation policies tailored to platform-specific needs. 
• Ensure high accuracy and efficiency in content detection. 
# 3. Scope of Work 
Phase 1: Requirement Analysis and Planning 
• Define types of inappropriate content. 
• Identify platform-specific moderation policies. 
• Develop a project roadmap and milestone schedule. 
Phase 2: System Design 
• Design modular architecture for text and image moderation pipelines. 
• Create a framework for easily updating moderation policies. 
Phase 3: Development 
• Implement NLP-based text moderation using models like BERT. 
• Implement CNN-based image moderation using models like ResNet. 
• Build a real-time web interface using Flask. 
Phase 4: Testing and Validation 
• Test model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score. 
• Collect feedback from test users and platform administrators. 
Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance 
• Deploy the system to target platforms. 
• Monitor performance and integrate updates as required. 
# 4. Methodology and Tools 
Languages and Frameworks: Python, Flask 
Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch 
NLP Tools: SpaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers 
Image Processing Tools: OpenCV, Pillow 
Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
Deployment Tools (optional): Docker, Heroku, or AWS for cloud deployment 
# 5. Proposed Features 
• Real-time text moderation using a BERT-based classifier. 
• Real-time image moderation using ResNet-based classifier. 
• Admin dashboard for customizing moderation thresholds. 
• Automatic flagging and reporting of harmful content. 
• Clean, intuitive web interface with input validation. 
# 6. Expected Outcomes 
• An end-to-end AI system capable of detecting and moderating harmful content. 
• Reduction in manual moderation workload. 
• Increased platform safety and compliance with content policies. 

# 5. Run the System 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python app.py 

This full proposal and implementation plan gives a clear, actionable path for building and 
delivering an AI-Powered Content Moderation System that is customizable, real-time, and 
accurate.
